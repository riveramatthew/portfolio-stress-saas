# Portfolio Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

This project provides a Python tool to perform stress testing and scenario analysis on investment portfolios. It fetches historical stock data, simulates economic scenarios (e.g., market crash, interest rate hike), and calculates potential impacts on portfolio value. It also includes a basic Value at Risk (VaR) calculation using historical simulation.

## Features
- Fetch historical stock data using Polygon API.
- Define custom portfolios with tickers and weights.
- Simulate scenarios like market crashes or sector-specific shocks.
- Calculate portfolio returns, volatility, and VaR.
- Visualize results with charts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `polygon-api-client`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
